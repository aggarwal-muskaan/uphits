## About ðŸŽ¶

A full-stack music web-app inspired from Spotify's consumer app.  
I've explored backend database schemas and migrations, API calls with serverless functions while developing **uphits**.

## Install & run

```
git clone https://github.com/aggarwal-muskaan/uphits.git
cd uphits
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Setup Database

Create Postgres DB on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), etc and copy the database connection string.  
Store it in `.env` file :

```
DATABASE_URL = ${connection_string}
```

For running seed script & locally launching [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-studio) studio, run commands:

```
npx prisma db seed
npx prisma studio
```
